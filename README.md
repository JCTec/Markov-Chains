# Markov-Chains
A Markov chain is a mathematical system that experiences transitions from one state to another according to certain probabilistic rules. 
The defining characteristic of a Markov chain is that no matter how the process arrived at its present state, the possible future states are fixed.

This is an implementation for an word prediction system.
